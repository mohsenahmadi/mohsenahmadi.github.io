# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I am a Project Manager, Product Manager and Scrum Master with the successful product/project management history. Highly skilled in collaborating with team members to achieve business and financial goals. In addition to learning more and more about successful Agile methods. On top of these, I am responsible for the project's key-stakeholders and build up an Agile culture on start-up steam. My aim is transferring my knowledge and experiences in Agile Project Management helping such Startups thrive quicker and stronger. So, I co-operated in some Startups and coach them on implementing project management solutions based on Agile frameworks. The end I have some experiences in journalism and writing contents in some famous media in my country when I was younger.
