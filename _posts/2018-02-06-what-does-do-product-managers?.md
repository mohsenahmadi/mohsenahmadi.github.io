As you know, the #Product_Management is one of the most important roles for the successful any business in IT industry. But this concept doesn’t have much age in this industry and maybe make some conflict between the other important roles such as #Product_Owner and #Project_Manager.
In this text, I’ll try to clear some points in in this position as follow.

The first step, I’ll explain what does doing every #product_manager in IT industry.
Every product manager should help to another team and department to grow the business and arrange them like as a conductor. It’s so near the project manager’s role in this field.
On Google, you can find this definition of the product manager:

> A Product Manager helps their team (and company) ship the right product to their users.

Now we would find the product manager involved which team to help them. Designers, engineers, QA, documentation, marketing and all of the stakeholders of your product in business needs to your help.
Some expert people believe the product manager must play as a CEO in organizations for growing the product. But I think leadership in this role is more important to anything. Although the authority is important too. You should be managing the product by building the useful and SMART roadmap and clear that to all the teams.
On clarifying the roadmap for other teams you can gather the votes for features with important factors such as business impact, technical effort, facilitate the operational staff and make customers happy.
After these steps and clear your roadmap, as a product manager, you must share it with all internal stakeholders and get their confirmation as soon as possible. You could set a deadline for this point.

Don’t forget the company’s overall goals and objectively covered in your prioritizing roadmap features and also, your team capacity.

In your position is most important to track all competitors every day
and monitor all your metrics to grow your product.
Set periodic sessions with all internal stakeholders and find all teams understand the challenge, product value target for delivering to end users, and get their feedback (internal stakeholders by listening and external stakeholders by tracing them on social media activities).

As a product manager you must know this point:
Your job is never done and you must improvement plan, additional testing, tracing market and competitors, response to your customers and analyze your data forever. When a product is dead, your job is finish and you must go home.

At the end of this texts, you must know As a product manager, you never go to write code because it is engineering role, you don’t create mock-ups for designer and you don’t have to make a marketing or PR plans. You must lead the all team without directly involved that.
