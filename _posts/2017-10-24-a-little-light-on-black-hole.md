At the previous story, I told trying to write story series on my experience as a Product Manager in a new business field.
In this story, I’ll write about an important concept in a structured company that moves the encounter to obscure issues as a new PM.
That’s sudden for me. In first days I must be knowing more about GDS (Global Distribution System) concept and create a road-map for migrating all working services and made many micro-service for using other product lines. So, I should prioritize tasks by business KPIs, Technical effort and also I can’t stop current workflow in this way.
After talking with domain expert’s developers and investigation by other teams (Marketing, Sales, Customer support, etc) I decided to start the first version and improve that again and again.
To the first step, I make a new mind-map and write all features, requirements and then classified them. Now, I found better look about this migration and relations between services and product lines. After this step, trying to classification these items to Theme, Epic, and Story via Google Sheet.
With these two simple steps, I accomplished better look about this migration and next steps.
In next story, I’ll write about our rules to make Epic, Story, Requirments, and Tasks.
