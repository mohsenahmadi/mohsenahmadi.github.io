Despite the general definition of the Project / Product management, which is temporary and unique management is not immediate and temporary. As a Project/Product Manager, you have a number of tasks to be done daily and weekly. But at the same time, you should not be involved in your daily routine and let routine works lead you to a steady pace.
One of the attractiveness of Project/Product management (for me at least) is the existence of challenges that can occur during project/product management. Challenges that make you think differently.
In this text, I’ll take a glimpse of the tasks that you have to do as a weekly project/product management.</p>

<p><strong>1. Meeting customers/stakeholders</strong>
The customers/stakeholders are the keys and the main element of each project/product. As long as the client does not exist, no projects will be formed. You have the least distance between yourself and your customers. Talk to them weekly, provide them with a brief overview of the progress or reasons for the project’s backwardness and hear their concerns and discuss with them the possible future risks of the project.</p>

<p><strong>2. Evaluation of project/product progress</strong>
Spending time with the project/product team on a weekly basis can increase your confidence in the progress of the work, and if there is a backlash in the projects, the root causes and corrective actions are the responsibility of controlling and directing them best.</p>

<p><strong>3. Review the project/product memories</strong>
Check the risks files of the project on a weekly basis and review and update them. Each moment you move forward with the project, the risk and risks log of your project also change. Always update this file by moving it forward with the project.</p>

<p><strong>4. Reviewing the criteria for updating</strong>
Update metrics check the percentages of project’s progress with the members of the project team. If the previous criteria are incorrect, modify them and always keep the progress of your project under control.</p>

<p><strong>5. Distribution of progress reports</strong>
Write the progress of the project and the achievements in one-page report and distribute it to all stakeholders and team members,
The budget and remaining information, the report of the percentage of physical progress, the time of arrival at the miles and the points of interest can form part of the title of your report.</p>

<p><strong>6. Look at the project/product from above (helicopter look)</strong>
Just like riding a helicopter, look at the top of your project and product. Make a bigger picture of the project. Behind the table, you long viewing angle limits your vision and makes difficult to make decisions. By changing your viewing angle, you can significantly help improve team performance and as a result, improve your product/project.</p>

<p><strong>7. Examining effective metrics</strong>
Always check the metrics that affect the progress and success of your product/project. If any of these metrics are suddenly reduced or increased, you should check the cause and identify the reasons for it.</p>
